# Requirements: RayQuasar Portfolio

**Defined:** 2026-03-13
**Core Value:** The interactive 3D robot chatbot experience — a cute robot that responds with emotions and animations based on LLM-generated answers — must work flawlessly.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Foundation

- ~~**FNDN-01**: Fix missing `"use client"` directives on components using React hooks~~ — N/A (old code removed)
- ~~**FNDN-02**: Fix basePath bug for CV download and asset URLs in production~~ — N/A (old code removed)
- [x] **FNDN-03**: Fix hreflang meta tags that declare routes returning 404

- [x] **ROBT-03**: 3D model loads with Suspense fallback and graceful loading indicator
- [x] **ROBT-04**: Robot is wrapped with `dynamic({ ssr: false })` to prevent static export build crash

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Light mode / theme toggle | Dark-only lab aesthetic is the brand identity |
| Contact form | Links sufficient; no backend email service needed |
| Real-time WebSocket chat | HTTP request/response is imperceptible for chatbot use case |
| CMS / admin panel | .md files in repo, developer-managed |
| User authentication | Public portfolio, no gated content |
| Animated/video hero background | Static image; robot provides the motion |
| Comment system on blog | Requires moderation; defer to v2 GitHub Discussions |
| Mobile app / PWA | Web-only focus |
| Multi-author blog | Personal portfolio, single author |
